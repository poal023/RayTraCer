# Raytracer

This project is a derivative work of Raytracing in One Weekend, done in C.

## Changes

Obviously, the project is in a procedural, C style instead of OOP. 

##TODO:
- Add support for output in jpeg or png files
- Add a triangle surface structure along with relevant functions (intersection, etc).
- Reimplement some features in SDL2
